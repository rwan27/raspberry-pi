Python code for connecting RPi to HD44780 LCD (16 x 2)
We assume RPi.GPIO python library has already been installed in RPi

USAGE:

from lcd import *

# done once to initialize
lcd_init() 

# print string "ABC" onto first line
lcd_string("ABC", LCD_LINE_1)

# print string "DEF" onto second line
lcd_string("DEF", LCD_LINE_2)
